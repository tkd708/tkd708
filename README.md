# About Me

Dr. Naoya Takeda is a post-doctoral researcher in the Sustainable Agriculture program at the Centre for Agriculture and the Bioeconomy (Queensland University of Technology). His expertise lies in agronomy and environmental sciences with research experiences in rice, sugarcane and grain and pasture systems. His research focuses on process understanding and upscaling of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycling in agroecosystems, with particular interests in the key soil processes and drivers of greenhouse gas (CO2, N2O, CH4) emissions, N losses and C sequestration. His approach integrates laboratry and field measurements of C and N flows such as greenhouse gas emissions, 15N fertiliser recovery, denitrification losses, net ecosystem exchange with empirical and mechanistic (e.g. APSIM, LandscapeDNDC, DayCent) modelling approaches. He aims to agronomic and environmental assessments of agroecosystems and supporting the decisions of farmers and policymakers to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
