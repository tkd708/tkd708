# About Me

Mr Naoya Takeda is currently pursuing PhD in the Sustainable Agriculture program at the Centre for Agriculture and the Bioeconomy (Queensland University of Technology). His expertise lies in agronomy and environmental sciences with research experiences in rice, sugarcane and grain cropping systems. His research focuses on nitrogen (N) use efficiency and N losses including nitrous oxide (N2O), with a particular interest in the mechanisms and drivers of N transformation processes in the soil. His approach combines field trials using the automated greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring system and 15N-labelled fertiliser as well as simulation analyses using cropping system models such as APSIM. He aims at providing agronomic and environmental assessments of cropping systems and supporting the decisions of farmers and policymakers to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
