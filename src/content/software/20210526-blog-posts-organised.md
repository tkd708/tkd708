excerpt: A tiny update of this personal website, re-orginising blog posts of research and software development into one page.
---

This is a tiny update of this personal website.

I had been uploading blog posts of research and software development on separate pages. However, I have worked on even more diverse activities and thought it would be hard to organise them on these two categories.
I would rather posts all the updates on one "blog" page and categorise them by the primary tag... so here it is!

Hopefully and more importantly, I can keep updating those activities in coming blog posts soon!
