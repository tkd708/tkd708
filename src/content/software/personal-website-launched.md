excerpt: My personal website is finally launched.... it's still got a lot of flaws but does the job!

Finally my personal website is launched, yay!

I'm going to update the contents to make this website into the platform integrating my activities.

This website is built using Gatsby and hosted by Netlify.

The starter kit I used is Ghost Casper, a great starter kit written with Typescript and Hocks... a pretty modern coding style hey.
Essentially, the theme design looks so cool! (And I deteriorated a bit lol)
