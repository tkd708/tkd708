excerpt: My personal website was renewed! I used the same starter but made it simpler. Here are the summary and future plans.

This personal website was renewed!
It was actually because I apparently updated the dependent packages wrongly and was stuck with errors one after another.

I used the same Gatsby starter (huge thanks to Ghost) but this time made the blog posts simpler, integrating all posts by tags.

While categories and tags are useful to look for blog posts by keywords, an increasing number of tags would make it difficult in the near future.
I might show the tags by categories.

Now I need to update the design of all the pages, home, about (including my CV now) and portfolio (including my publications now) ideally with more photos and figures.

I know it's super short again but let's prioritise uploading frequency for now...
