## Carbon credit market

Many contries have pledged **Carbon Neutral** targets and their **Green growth** strategies have been released.

**Carbon credit** system is a key to acheive those targets.

A good introduction of the cabon credit market

## Emissions reduction fund

The procedures to get accredited are summarised in the following link.

Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) are one of the carbon credit systems the Australian governement accepts.

## Agricultural method

Within the ERF, there are (a) Agricultural methods, (b) Savanna burning methods and (c) Vegetation nethods for the land sector.

Vegetation methods are basically forest management including tree planting and savanna burning is management to prevent bush fire.

Within the agricultural methods, there are (a) piggery, (b) cattle, (c) dairy, (d) irrigated cotton and (e) soil carbon methods.

## Soil carbon method

2018 methods rely only on soil sampling, taking 5 years.
2021 methods combine soil sampling and modelling & simulation, allowing to accredition every year.
It's moving towards more model-based evaluation system.
