## Greenhouse Gas and Climate Change

---

Greenhouse gas (GHG) is a term for gases which trap heat in the atmosphere. Major GHGs are carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O). Anthropogenic GHG emissions since the pre-industrial era have been increasing (Fig. 1) and driven large increases in the atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O.

As widely known, emissions of GHG contribute to the increase in the global temperature. More than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was attributed to the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together (Fig. 2).

## Nitrous oxide

---

Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) is a long-lived atmospheric trace gas with a global warming potential 265–298 times higher than that of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) over a 100-year period (Myhre et al., 2013). Also, N<sub>2</sub>O has been considered the primary ozone-depleting substance in the 21st century (Ravishankara et al., 2009; Portmann et al., 2012). Croplands are globally responsible for 66% of total anthropogenic N<sub>2</sub>O emissions and these emissions are predicted to double by 2050 (Davidson & Kanter, 2014). In soils, N<sub>2</sub>O is mainly produced by the microbial processes of autotrophic nitrification (oxidation of ammonium to nitrate) and heterotrophic denitrification (reduction of nitrate to N<sub>2</sub>O and ultimately N2) (Butterbach-bahl et al., 2013) (Fig. 3).

A range of soil parameters influences these processes, such as oxygen (O2) availability (often indicated by soil moisture), temperature, organic carbon (C) availability and substrate (NH4+ and NO3-) availability (Butterbach-bahl et al., 2013). The magnitude of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from a cropping system is promoted particularly by N fertiliser inputs, which are estimated to account for 54% of the total increase of the global N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in the recent decade (Tian et al., 2019). Efficient use of N fertiliser in agricultural systems is thus essential to balancing productivity and environmental impacts.
