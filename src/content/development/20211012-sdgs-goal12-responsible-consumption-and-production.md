# Responsible Consumption and Production

SDGs Goal 12 is "Responsible Consumption and Production" - Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. The goal has focuses on **water, energy and food**.

> The global material footprint increased by 70% between 2000 and 2017.

> Less than 3% of the world’s water is fresh (drinkable), of which 2.5% is frozen in the Antarctica, Arctic and glaciers. Humanity must therefore rely on 0.5% for all of man’s ecosystem’s and freshwater needs.

> Water use has been increasing worldwide by about 1% per year since the 1980s.

> More than 1 billion people still do not have access to fresh water. Over 2 billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress.

> Agriculture (including irrigation, livestock and aquaculture) is by far the largest water consumer, accounting for 69% of annual water withdrawals globally. Industry (including power generation) accounts for 19% and households for 12%.

> Each year, an estimated one third of all food produced – equivalent to 1.3 billion tonnes worth around $1 trillion – ends up rotting in the bins of consumers and retailers, or spoiling due to poor transportation and harvesting practices.

> If people worldwide switched to energy efficient light bulbs the world would save US$120 billion annually.

> Should the global population reach 9.6 billion by 2050, the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles.

> Each year, an estimated 1/3 of all food produced – equivalent to 1.3 billion tons worth around $1 trillion – ends up rotting in the bins of consumers and retailers, or spoiling due to poor transportation and harvesting practices

> The food sector accounts for around 30% of the world’s total energy consumption and accounts for around 22% of total Greenhouse Gas emissions.

## What's been suggested?

Goal 12 Responsible Consumption and Production has got the following 11 targets (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/).

> 12.1 Implement the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries

> 12.2 By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources

> 12.3 By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses

> 12.4 By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment

> 12.5 By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse

> 12.6 Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle

> 12.7 Promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities

> 12.8 By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature

> 12.A Support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production

> 12.B Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products

> 12.C Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities

## Why that's important?

The link above also had got a brief report [Why It Matters](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/12_Why-It-Matters-2020.pdf)

> Economic and social progress over the last century has been accompanied by environmental degradation that is endangering the very systems on which our future development and very survival depend

<br>

## How far are we?

In addition to "Why It Matters" above, [Progress and Info](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12) is updated for each year and [Sustainable Development Goals Report](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2021/goal-12/) shows the key points of the latest situation and prograss related to Goal 12.

> The share of renewable energy in final energy consumption has reached 17.5% in 2015.

> The global electrification rate reached 89% in 2017 (from 83% in 2010), still leaving about 840 million people without access

> The global population without access to electricity fell from 1.2 billion in 2010 to 840 million in 2017

...Again, I will read studies and reports relevant to this goal and keep updating this post or even write an individual post for each subtopic!
