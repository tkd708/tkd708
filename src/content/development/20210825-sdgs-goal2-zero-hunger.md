# Zero Hunger

SDGs Goal 2 is "Zero Hunger" - End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture

> After decades of steady decline, the number of people who suffer from hunger – as measured by the prevalence of undernourishment – began to slowly increase again in 2015. Current estimates show that nearly **690 million people are hungry**, or 8.9 percent of the world population – up by 10 million people in one year and by nearly 60 million in five years.

> The majority of the world’s undernourished – 381 million – are still found in Asia. More than 250 million live in Africa, where the number of undernourished is growing faster than anywhere in the world.

> With more than a quarter of a billion people potentially at the brink of starvation, swift action needs to be taken to provide food and humanitarian relief to the most at-risk regions.

> At the same time, **a profound change of the global food and agriculture system is needed** if we are to nourish the more than 690 million people who are hungry today – and the **additional 2 billion people the world will have by 2050**. Increasing agricultural productivity and sustainable food production are crucial to help alleviate the perils of hunger.

## What's been suggested?

Goal 2 Zero Hunger has got the following eight targets (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/).

> 2.1 By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round.

> 2.2 By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons.

> 2.3 By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment.

> 2.4 By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality.

> 2.5 By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed.

> 2.A Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in particular least developed countries.

> 2.B Correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect, in accordance with the mandate of the Doha Development Round.

> 2.C Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility.

## Why that's important?

The link above also had got a brief report [Why It Matters](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2_Why-It-Matters-2020.pdf)

> Extreme hunger and malnutrition remains a barrier to sustainable development and creates a trap from which people cannot easily escape. Hunger and malnutrition mean less productive individuals, who are more prone to disease and thus often unable to earn more and improve their livelihoods.

> We all want our families to have enough food to eat what is safe and nutritious. A world with zero hunger can positively impact our economies, health, education, equality and social development.

> Additionally, with hunger limiting human development, we will not be able to achieve the other sustainable development goals such as education, health and gender equality.

## How far are we?

[Progress and Info](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2) is updated for each year and [Sustainable Development Goals Report](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2021/goal-02/) shows the key points of the latest situation and prograss related to Goal 2.

> The world is not on track to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030. If recent trends continue, the number of people affected by hunger would surpass 840 million by 2030.

> According to the World Food Programme, 135 million suffer from acute hunger largely due to man-made conflicts, climate change and economic downturns. The COVID-19 pandemic could now double that number, putting an additional 130 million people at risk of suffering acute hunger by the end of 2020.

> In 2019, close to 750 million – or nearly one in ten people in the world – were exposed to severe levels of food insecurity.

> An estimated 2 billion people in the world did not have regular access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food in 2019.

> If recent trends continue, the number of people affected by hunger will surpass 840 million by 2030, or 9.8 percent of the global population.

> 144 million children under age 5 were affected by stunting in 2019, with three quarters living in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

> In 2019, 6.9 per cent (or 47 million) children under 5 were affected by wasting, or acute undernutrition, a condition caused by limited nutrient intake and infection.

Impcacts of COVID-19 on global povety are estimated and reported in [COVID-19: Potential impact on the world’s poorest people](https://docs.wfp.org/api/documents/WFP-0000114205/download/?_ga=2.241337546.952775517.1586900153-341597442.1584735263).

### Related studies and topics

This Goal 2 includes broad topics associated with agriculture and food, such as **Land Use**, **Water Footprint**, **Food Waste**, **Diet**, **Animal Welfare** as well as with other SDGs.

So many publications are listed on UN's [Food security and nutrition and sustainable agriculture](https://sdgs.un.org/topics/food-security-and-nutrition-and-sustainable-agriculture) and [Rural Development](https://sdgs.un.org/topics/rural-development).

It's been almost 10 years already but [WORLD AGRICULTURE TOWARDS 2030/2050](fao.org/3/ap106e/ap106e.pdf) demonstrates issues and prospectives of agriculture at global scale, highly related to Goal 2.

In Japan, JICA has targeted several goals aligned with Goal 2 as stated in [ゴール 2 の達成に向けた JICA の取組方針](https://www.jica.go.jp/aboutoda/sdgs/ku57pq00002e2b2a-att/goal02_j.pdf).
