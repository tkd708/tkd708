# Affordable and Clean Energy

SDGs Goal 7 is "Affordable and Clean Energy" - Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy.

> More focused attention is needed to improve access to clean and safe cooking fuels and technologies for 3 billion people, to expand the use of renewable energy beyond the electricity sector, and to increase electrification in sub-Saharan Africa.

> 13% of the global population still lacks access to modern electricity. 3 billion people rely on wood, coal, charcoal or animal waste for cooking and heating

> Energy is the dominant contributor to climate change, accounting for around 60% of total global greenhouse gas emissions.

> Indoor air pollution from using combustible fuels for household energy caused 4.3 million deaths in 2012, with women and girls accounting for 6 out of every 10 of these.

## What's been suggested?

Goal 7 is Affordable and Clean Energy has got the following 5 targets (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/energy/).

> 7.1 By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services

> 7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix

> 7.3 By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency

> 7.A By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology

> 7.B By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support

<br>

## Why that's important?

The link above also had got a brief report [Why It Matters](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/7_Why-It-Matters-2020.pdf)

> A well-established energy system supports all sectors: from businesses, medicine and education to agriculture, infrastructure, communications and high-technology.

> For many decades, fossil fuels such as coal, oil or gas have been major sources of electricity production, but burning carbon fuels produces large amounts of greenhouse gases which cause climate change and have harmful impacts on peopleâ€™s well-being and the environment. This affects everyone, not just a few

> Without a stable electricity supply, countries will not be able to power their economies.

## How far are we?

In addition to "Why It Matters" above, [Progress and Info](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal7) is updated for each year and [Sustainable Development Goals Report](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2021/goal-07/) shows the key points of the latest situation and prograss related to Goal 7.

> In 2016, the share of renewables increased at the fastest rate since 2012, up 0.24%, and reached almost 17.5% owing to rapid growth in hydropower, wind, and solar.

> The global electricity access rate improved from 83% in 2010 to 90% in 2019, with 1.1 billion people receiving electricity for the first time.

> However, 759 million people were still without access in 2019, with three quarters of them in sub-Saharan Africa. At the current pace, 660 million people will still be without electricity in 2030, the vast majority of whom (555 million) will be in sub-Saharan Africa.

> In 2010, 57% of the global population were using clean cooking fuels and technologies, rising to 66% in 2019. This means that 2.6 billion people have been left behind.

> The share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption gradually increased to 17.1% in 2018, up from 16.4 in 2010. The main contribution came from the electricity sector, where the share of renewables now exceeds 25%. Nonetheless, electricity makes up only around 21% of final energy use.

...Again, I will read studies and reports relevant to this goal and keep updating this post or even write an individual post for each subtopic!
