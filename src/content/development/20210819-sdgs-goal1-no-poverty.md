# No Poverty

SDGs Goal 1 is "No Poverty" - End poverty in all its forms everywhere

> According to the most recent estimates, in 2015, **10 percent of the world’s population** or 734 million people **lived on less than $1.90 a day**.

> **One out of five children live in extreme poverty**, and the negative effects of poverty and deprivation in the early years have ramifications that can last a lifetime.

> In 2016, 55 per cent of the world’s population – about 4 billion people – did not benefit from any form of social protection

## What's been suggested?

Goal 1 No Poverty has got following seven targets (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/poverty/).

> 1.1 By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day

> 1.2 By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions

> 1.3 Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable

> 1.4 By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance

> 1.5 By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters

> 1.A Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions

> 1.B Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions

## Why that's important?

The link above also had got a brief report ["Why It Matters"](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1_Why-It-Matters-2020.pdf)

> Growing inequality is detrimental to economic growth and undermines social cohesion, increasing political and social tensions and, in some circumstances, driving instability and conflicts.

> Strong social protection systems are essential for mitigating the effects and preventing many people from falling into poverty.

### Inclusive Growth

["Inclusive Growth"](https://www.oecd.org/inclusive-growth/).

持続的成長のけん引力としての BOP 層支援および貧困解消の重要性

[JICA Development Cooporation Literature Review No. 8 (in Japanese)](https://www.jica.go.jp/jica-ri/ja/publication/litreview/l75nbg00000080pr-att/JICA-RI_Literature_Review_No.8.pdf)

> 包摂的成長とは成長の歩みとパターンの問題であるとして、何よりも高い経済成長が貧困をより大きく削減することを強調する。その根拠として、所得の伸びによって短期では貧困削減の７割が、長期では 97％が説明されてしまうという実証研究が紹介されている。

<br>

## How far are we?

> The share of the world’s workers living in extreme poverty fell by half over the last decade: from 14.3 per cent in 2010 to 7.1 per cent in 2019.

> Even before COVID-19, baseline projections suggested that 6 per cent of the global population would still be living in extreme poverty in 2030, missing the target of ending poverty. The fallout from the pandemic threatens to push over 70 million people into extreme poverty.

> Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are expected to see the largest increases in extreme poverty, with an additional 32 million and 26 million people, respectively, living below the international poverty line as a result of the pandemic.

Impcacts of COVID-19 on global povety are estimated and reported in ["Estimates of the impact of COVID-19 on global poverty"](https://www.wider.unu.edu/publication/estimates-impact-covid-19-global-poverty).

Some of the key messages are...

> Global poverty could increase for the first time since 1990 and, depending on the poverty line, such increase could represent a reversal of approximately a decade in the world’s progress in reducing poverty.

> Under the most extreme scenario of a 20 per cent income or consumption contraction, the number of people living in poverty could increase by 420–580 million.

## Future prospectives?

## How do my interests and career options relate with it?

...It's such a big topic obviously, I will read studies and reports relevant to this goal and keep updating this post!
