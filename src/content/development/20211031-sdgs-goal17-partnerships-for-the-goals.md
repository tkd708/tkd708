# Partnerships for the Goals

SDGs Goal 17 is "Partnerships for the Goals" - Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.

> Net Official Development Assistance flows by member countries of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development totaled $147.4 billion in 2019.

> 79% of imports from developing countries enter developed countries duty-free

> The debt burden on developing countries remains stable at about 3% of export revenue

> Trade, foreign direct investment and remittances all projected to decline by up to 40% in 2020.

> Almost half of the world’s population is not connected to the internet, particularly in poor countries.

## What's been suggested?

Goal 17 Partnerships for the Goals has got the following 19 targets (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/globalpartnerships/).

### Finance

> 17.1 Strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection

> 17.2 Developed countries to implement fully their official development assistance commitments, including the commitment by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7% of ODA/GNI to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.20% of ODA/GNI to least developed countries ODA providers are encouraged to consider setting a target to provide at least 0.20% of ODA/GNI to least developed countries

> 17.3 Mobilize additional financial resources for developing countries from multiple sources

> 17.4 Assist developing countries in attaining long-term debt sustainability through coordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, debt relief and debt restructuring, as appropriate, and address the external debt of highly indebted poor countries to reduce debt distress

> 17.5 Adopt and implement investment promotion regimes for least developed countries

### Technology

> 17.6 Enhance North-South, South-South and triangular regional and international cooperation on and access to science, technology and innovation and enhance knowledge sharing on mutually agreed terms, including through improved coordination among existing mechanisms, in particular at the United Nations level, and through a global technology facilitation mechanism

> 17.7 Promote the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on favourable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms, as mutually agreed

> 17.8 Fully operationalize the technology bank and science, technology and innovation capacity-building mechanism for least developed countries by 2017 and enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology

### Capacity building

> 17.9 Enhance international support for implementing effective and targeted capacity-building in developing countries to support national plans to implement all the sustainable development goals, including through North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation

### Trade

> 17.10 Promote a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization, including through the conclusion of negotiations under its Doha Development Agenda

> 17.11 Significantly increase the exports of developing countries, in particular with a view to doubling the least developed countries’ share of global exports by 2020

> 17.12 Realize timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access on a lasting basis for all least developed countries, consistent with World Trade Organization decisions, including by ensuring that preferential rules of origin applicable to imports from least developed countries are transparent and simple, and contribute to facilitating market access

### Systemic issues

### Policy and institutional coherence

> 17.13 Enhance global macroeconomic stability, including through policy coordination and policy coherence

> 17.14 Enhance policy coherence for sustainable development

> 17.15 Respect each country’s policy space and leadership to establish and implement policies for poverty eradication and sustainable development

### Multi-stakeholder partnerships

> 17.16 Enhance the global partnership for sustainable development, complemented by multi-stakeholder partnerships that mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources, to support the achievement of the sustainable development goals in all countries, in particular developing countries

> 17.17 Encourage and promote effective public, public-private and civil society partnerships, building on the experience and resourcing strategies of partnerships

### Data, monitoring and accountability

> 17.18 By 2020, enhance capacity-building support to developing countries, including for least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts

> 17.19 By 2030, build on existing initiatives to develop measurements of progress on sustainable development that complement gross domestic product, and support statistical capacity-building in developing countries

## Why that's important?

The link above also had got a brief report [Why It Matters](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/17_Why-It-Matters-2020.pdf)

> The SDGs can only be realized with strong global partnerships and cooperation.

> A successful development agenda requires inclusive partnerships — at the global, regional, national and local levels — built upon principles and values, and upon a shared vision and shared goals placing people and the planet at the centre.

> Many countries require Official Development Assistance to encourage growth and trade. Yet, aid levels are falling and donor countries have not lived up to their pledge to ramp up development finance.

> Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy is projected to contract sharply, by 3%, in 2020, experiencing its worst recession since the Great Depression.

> Strong international cooperation is needed now more than ever to ensure that countries have the means to recover from the pandemic, build back better and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

## How far are we?

In addition to "Why It Matters" above, [Progress and Info](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal17) is updated for each year and [Sustainable Development Goals Report](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2021/goal-17/) shows the key points of the latest situation and prograss related to Goal 17.

> Net ODA flows by member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reached $161 billion in 2020, an increase of 7% in real terms from 2019, driven by members’ support of an inclusive global recovery in light of the pandemic and an increase in bilateral sovereign lending by some loan-giving members. Net ODA flows represented 0.32% of donors’ combined gross national income (GNI) in 2020, falling short of the 0.7% target.

> Foreign direct investment flows fell sharply in 2020, especially to poorer regions - In 2020, FDI fell by up to 40%, dropping below $1 trillion (from $1.5 trillion in 2019) for the first time since 2005. Lockdown measures slowed existing investment projects, and the prospect of a deep recession led multinational enterprises to reassess new projects.

> Defying predictions, officially recorded remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries reached $540 billion in 2020, only 1.6% below the 2019 level. Drivers included fiscal stimulus that resulted in better-than-expected economic conditions in host countries, a shift in flows from cash to digital and from informal to formal channels, and cyclical movements in oil prices and currency exchange rates.

> Total ODA for capacity-building and national planning amounted to $35.9 billion in 2019 and represented 14% of total sector allocable aid, a figure that has been stable since 2010. The main sectors assisted were energy policy, public administration and the financial sector, which received a total of $13.8 billion.

> For the period from 2017 to 2019, the worldwide weighted tariff average has remained steady at around 2%. Agriculture and clothing still have the highest tariff averages at around 6%, followed by textiles at around 4%.

> Since the adoption of the SDGs, funding for data and statistics has increased four years in a row. It grew from $591 million in 2015 to $693 million in 2018, with significant increases for SIDS, landlocked developing countries and LDCs. However, support was levelling off in 2019.
