excerpt: Sustainable development has been in the centre of my career interests since my undergrad. I have been working on this big theme from agricultural perspetive and would like to re-think this to overview my research interests and surounding topics. This post is an introductory and summarising one for a series of relevant posts (hopefully coming more frequently!).

# Sustainable Development

" Sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."
https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda-retired/

This has been in the centre of my career interests since my undergrad and I have been studying agriculture as a major in this context. Being in the third year in my PhD study and thinking of future steps, I think it is a good timing to overview this global issue again and relate my interests with it to consider next actions of mine.

To this end, I would like to do a small research on frameworks to tackle sustainability issues and summarise relevant topics in a series of posts.

This is an introductory posts overviewing frameworks I'm going to investigate, such as SDGs, Planetary boundaries and ESG investing.

## SDGs

Needless to say, **Sustainable Development Goals** (SDGs) are the most well-known and universal agenda for sustainable development, promising **"Leave No One Behind"**.

There are **17 goals and 169 targets** to be achieved **by 2030**.
These goals and targets as well as its bfief background are explained in UN's official website (https://sdgs.un.org/goals).

Details can also be found in the following websites.
https://www.africa.undp.org/content/rba/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/background.html
https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2015/09/summit-charts-new-era-of-sustainable-development-world-leaders-to-gavel-universal-agenda-to-transform-our-world-for-people-and-planet/

UN also explains these goals from more business-oriented perspectives too.
https://www.unglobalcompact.org/sdgs/17-global-goals

Some countries have established their own actions to contribute to SDGs and been publishing their progresses (examples below).

Japan: https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/gaiko/oda/sdgs/index.html

Australia: https://sdgs.org.au/

To overview the progress in SDGs, **Sustainable Development Report** has been reporting each country's achievements in each goal and target in depth and conprehensively.
https://sdgindex.org/

Also, Monash University and McMaster University offer a collection of studies relevant to SDGs (and more!) from all over the world.

["Social System Evidence"](https://www.socialsystemsevidence.org/)

I will go through these goals one by one in future posts!

## Planetary Boundaries

!["Planetary boundaries"](../img/development/planetary-boundaries.png)

**Planetary Boundaries** have also been referred to as key indicators and thretholds for sustainable development, which were consisted of **nine planetary boundaries** and suggested in 2009 by a group of international scientists at **Stockholm Resilience Centre** led by a former centre director Johan Rockström.

"The planetary boundaries concept presents a set of nine planetary boundaries within which humanity can continue to develop and thrive for generations to come"
https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html

"The science shows that these nine processes and systems regulate the stability and resilience of the Earth System – the interactions of land, ocean, atmosphere and life that together provide conditions upon which our societies depend."
https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2015-01-15-planetary-boundaries---an-update.html

These boundaries are strongly science-based and often talked together with SDGs towards a direction of "How to achieve SDGs within the planetary boundaries?"

Since, my research topics are closely associated with these boundaries, I would like to catch up with the latest discussion on them by reviewing scientific papers.

## ESG investing

!["ESG Investing"](../img/development/esg-investing.jpg)

**Environmental, social and governance investing** (ESG investing) is a form of socially responsible investing that prioritizes financial returns alongside a company’s impact on the environment, its stakeholders, and the planet.

ESG investing was suggested in **Principles for Responsible Investment** (https://www.unpri.org/) in 2006, moving the finantial sector globally towards more long-term evaluation of growth.
https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgkell/2018/07/11/the-remarkable-rise-of-esg/?sh=bc7ba4a16951

ESG investing has been rapidly growing by 143% over 2016-20 and mainly led by Europe and the US, reaching equivalent to US$25.2 trillion (or US$35.3 trillion as "sustainable investment", accounting for 36% of total assets!).
http://www.gsi-alliance.org/

There are quite a few third-party ESG-rating companies, for example...

Sustainalytics: https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-ratings/

MSCI: https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/esg-investing/esg-ratings/esg-ratings-corporate-search-tool

The ESG criteria are closely related to SDGs and as a result propelling actions towards SDGs.

Even though this is a highly business-oriented topic, I want to understand the concept and the actual situation of this movement as a strong driving factor to achieve sustainable development.

## Perspectives of my little investigation...

For each topic in those frameworks, I will do research and summarise from following perspectives.

- What's been suggested?
- Why that's important?
- How far are we?
- Future prospectives?
- How do my interests and career options relate with it?

The first two points would be almost re-capping what officials have reported... probably nothing really new or unique (as written above, it's been nearly or over 10 years since suggested!) but I want to go them through to have a good understanding of the base of current discussion on sustainablity issues for myself.

I would like to introduce some of the latest key publications for each of them in third and fourth points, reaching a little beyond what's in big reports depending on the topic.

Then, I will discuss the topic in relavance to my own interests and career options so that I can outline my future steps on top of these topics. As a sub-theme of this, I would like to think of a question, "How can these global-scale issues be linked to more personal experiences, emotions and actions?"

I hope to have a sound understanding to discuss and/or possibily to advocate these issues through this investigation... approaching to a sustainable expert?
