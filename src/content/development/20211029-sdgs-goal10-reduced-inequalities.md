# Reduced Inequality

SDGs Goal 10 is "Reduced Inequality" - Reduce inequality within and among countries.

> Reducing inequalities and ensuring no one is left behind are integral to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

> Inequality within and among countries is a persistent cause for concern. Despite some positive signs toward reducing inequality in some dimensions, such as reducing relative income inequality in some countries and preferential trade status benefiting lower-income countries, inequality still persists.

> Evidence from developing countries shows that children in the poorest 20% of the populations are still up to three times more likely to die before their fifth birthday than children in the richest quintiles.

> Social protection has been significantly extended globally, yet persons with disabilities are up to five times more likely than average to incur catastrophic health expenditures.

> Despite overall declines in maternal mortality in most developing countries, women in rural areas are still up to three times more likely to die while giving birth than women living in urban centers.

> Up to 30% of income inequality is due to inequality within households, including between women and men. Women are also more likely than men to live below 50% of the median income

> Of the one billion population of persons with disabilities, 80% live in developing countries. One in ten children is a child with a disability. Only 28% of persons with significant disabilities have access to disability benefits globally, and only 1per cent in low-income countries.

## What's been suggested?

Goal 10 Reduced Inequality has got the following 10 targets (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/inequality/).

> 10.1 By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average

> 10.2 By 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status

> 10.3 Ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard

> 10.4 Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection policies, and progressively achieve greater equality

> 10.5 Improve the regulation and monitoring of global financial markets and institutions and strengthen the implementation of such regulations

> 10.6 Ensure enhanced representation and voice for developing countries in decision-making in global international economic and financial institutions in order to deliver more effective, credible, accountable and legitimate institutions

> 10.7 Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies

> 10.A Implement the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, in accordance with World Trade Organization agreements

> 10.B Encourage official development assistance and financial flows, including foreign direct investment, to States where the need is greatest, in particular least developed countries, African countries, small island developing States and landlocked developing countries, in accordance with their national plans and programmes

> 10.C By 2030, reduce to less than 3% the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5%

## Why that's important?

The link above also had got a brief report [Why It Matters](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10_Why-It-Matters-2020.pdf)

> Inequalities based on income, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, race, class, ethnicity, religion and opportunity continue to persist across the world.

> Inequality threatens longterm social and economic development, harms poverty reduction and destroys peopleâ€™s sense of fulfilment and self-worth. This, in turn, can breed crime, disease and environmental degradation.

> We cannot achieve sustainable development and make the planet better for all if people are excluded from the chance for a better life.

## How far are we?

In addition to "Why It Matters" above, [Progress and Info](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10) is updated for each year and [Sustainable Development Goals Report](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2021/goal-10/) shows the key points of the latest situation and prograss related to Goal 10.

> Despite some positive signs, inequality is growing for more than 70% of the global population, exacerbating the risks of divisions and hampering economic and social development.

> COVID-19 has deepened existing inequalities, hitting the poorest and most vulnerable communities the hardest. It has put a spotlight on economic inequalities and fragile social safety nets that leave vulnerable communities to bear the brunt of the crisis. At the same time, social, political and economic inequalities have amplified the impacts of the pandemic.

> By mid-2020, the number of people who had fled their countries and become refugees due to war, conflict, persecution, human rights violations and events seriously disturbing public order had grown to 24 million, the highest absolute number on record. For every 100,000 persons, 307 are refugees outside their country of origin, more than double from 2010.

> The Gini index is one of the most commonly used measures of income inequality. It ranges between 0 and 100, where 0 indicates that income is shared equally among all people, and 100 indicates the extreme situation where one person accounts for all income. Prior to COVID-19, the average Gini index for emerging market and developing countries had been falling. However, the World Economic Outlook, October 2020 of the International Monetary Fund estimates that COVID-19 will increase the average Gini index for these countries by 2.6 points to 42.7 (a 6% increase).

> Some of the most effective mechanisms Governments have for reducing economic inequalities are taxes, and cash and in-kind transfers. The difference in the Gini index before and after taxes and social transfers provides a measure of how effective these policies are at redistributing incomes and lowering inequality. Overall, the impacts are largest in high-income countries, with an average reduction in the Gini index of 10%, compared with just 1% among the low-income countries.
