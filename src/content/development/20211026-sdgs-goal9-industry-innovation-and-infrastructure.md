# Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure

SDGs Goal 9 is "Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure" - Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.

> Inclusive and sustainable industrialization, together with innovation and infrastructure, can unleash dynamic and competitive economic forces that generate employment and income. They play a key role in introducing and promoting new technologies, facilitating international trade and enabling the efficient use of resources.

> In 2018, 96% of the world’s population lived within reach of a mobile-cellular signal, and 90% of people could access the Internet through a third generation (3G) or higher-quality network. 16% of the global population does not have access to mobile broadband networks.

> The global share of manufacturing value added in GDP increased from 15.2% in 2005 to 16.3% in 2017, driven by the fast growth of manufacturing in Asia.

> Least developed countries have immense potential for industrialization in food and beverages (agro-industry), and textiles and garments, with good prospects for sustained employment generation and higher productivity

> In 2019, the amount of new renewable power capacity added (excluding large hydro) was the highest ever, at 184 gigawatts, 20GW more than in 2018. This included 118GW of new solar systems, and 61GW of wind turbines.

> Capacity investment in solar slipped 3% to $131.1 billion in 2019, while that in wind climbed 6% to $138.2 billion – the first time that wind has outweighed solar in terms of dollars committed since 2010.

> Developing countries continued to outpace developed economies in renewables investment. In 2019, they committed $152.2 billion, compared to $130 billion for developed countries.

## What's been suggested?

Goal 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure has got the following 8 targets (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/infrastructure-industrialization/).

> 9.1 Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all

> 9.2 Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries

> 9.3 Increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing countries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and markets

> 9.4 By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities

> 9.5 Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending

> 9.A Facilitate sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries through enhanced financial, technological and technical support to African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States 18

> 9.B Support domestic technology development, research and innovation in developing countries, including by ensuring a conducive policy environment for, inter alia, industrial diversification and value addition to commodities

> 9.C Significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020

## Why that's important?

The link above also had got a brief report [Why It Matters](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/9_Why-It-Matters-2020.pdf)

> Economic growth, social development and climate action are heavily dependent on investments in infrastructure, sustainable industrial development and technological progress.

> In the face of a rapidly changing global economic landscape and increasing inequalities, sustained growth must include industrialization that first of all, makes opportunities accessible to all people, and second, is supported by innovation and resilient infrastructure.

> The growth of new industries means improvement in the standard of living for many of us. If industries pursue sustainability, this approach will have a positive effect on the environment.

## How far are we?

In addition to "Why It Matters" above, [Progress and Info](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal9) is updated for each year and [Sustainable Development Goals Report](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2021/goal-09/) shows the key points of the latest situation and prograss related to Goal 9.

> Due to tariffs and trade tensions between the world’s dominant economies, global manufacturing growth was already in decline before the COVID-19 pandemic.

> Least developed countries, in particular, need to accelerate the development of their manufacturing sector if they are to meet the 2030 target, and scale up investment in scientific research and innovation.

> The pandemic hit the manufacturing sector harder than during the 2007–2009 global financial crisis, resulting in a drop in production of 6.8% in 2020. The share of manufacturing value added (MVA) in global GDP fell - from 2019 to 2020 – from 16.6% to 16.0%.

> The year 2020 was catastrophic for air travel demand. Air passengers dropped from 4.5 billion globally in 2019 to 1.8 billion in 2020, a 60% decline.

> Economic recovery in the latter half of 2020 was fuelled by the manufacture of medium- and high-tech products.

> Increased investment in research and development is essential to finding solutions for crises such as COVID-19. The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines demonstrates the critical role of innovation in unexpected crises. Global investment in R&D reached $2.2 trillion (purchasing power parity) in 2018, up from $1.4 trillion in 2010.

> Rural road connectivity provides farmers and their families easy access to markets, along with health and education facilities. This helps reduce poverty by elevating agricultural productivity, business profitability and employment. Rural access index data – measuring the proportion of people within two kilometres of an all-season road – from 25 countries mostly developing countries for 2018 to 2019 indicate that almost 300 million out of 520 million rural dwellers lack good access to roads.

> In 2020, almost the entire world population lived within range of mobile networks, with 85% covered by a fourth-generation (4G) network. owever, “coverage” does not necessarily mean “usage”: only 51% of the population used the Internet in 2019, leaving 3.7 billion people without Internet access.

...Again, I will read studies and reports relevant to this goal and keep updating this post or even write an individual post for each subtopic!
