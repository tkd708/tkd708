So, I have gone through all the SDGs... well, I understand it is just touching the basis of each goal but still great to know the overview, basic facts and some numbers.

### Indicators, their current states and prospectives

### COVID-19 vulnarables are more susceptible

# Good Health and Well-Being

SDGs Goal 3 is "Good Health and Well-Being" - Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. It focuses on (1) child health, (2) maternal health and (3) HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases.

> Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being at all ages is essential to sustainable development. Currently, the world is facing a global health crisis unlike any other â€” COVID-19 is spreading human suffering, destabilizing the global economy and upending the lives of billions of people around the globe.

### sub category

> In 2018 **an estimated 6.2 million children and adolescents under the age of 15 years died**, mostly from preventable causes. Of these deaths, 5.3 million occurred in the first 5 years, with almost half of these in the first month of life.

## What's been suggested?

Goal 3 Good Health and Well-Being has got the following 13 targets (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/health/).

> 3.1 By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births.

<br>

## Why that's important?

The link above also had got a brief report [Why It Matters](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3_Why-It-Matters-2020.pdf)

> Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being is important to building prosperous societies.

<br>

## How far are we?

In addition to "Why It Matters" above, [Progress and Info](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3) is updated for each year and [Sustainable Development Goals Report](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2021/goal-03/) shows the key points of the latest situation and prograss related to Goal 3.

> COVID-19 disproportionately affects the elderly, the poor, refugees and migrants, and a broad range of vulnerable groups due to their specific health and socioeconomic circumstances, poor living conditions and lack of access to high-quality public health care.

...Again, I will read studies and reports relevant to this goal and keep updating this post or even write an individual post for each subtopic!
